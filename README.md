# gatsby-boilerplate
This is a front end boilerplate based on Gatsby. It started from the Gatsby
[auth tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/authentication-tutorial/) and was
customized to work with
the [koa boilerplate](https://github.com/christroutner/babel-free-koa2-api-boilerplate) back
end. Eventually it will incorporate
the [react component library](https://github.com/zksailor534/react-adminlte-dash) based
on the [AdminLTE](https://github.com/almasaeed2010/AdminLTE) control panel.
